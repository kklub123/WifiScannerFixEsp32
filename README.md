MADE FOR A ALIEXPRESS BOOTLEG KNOCKOFF OFF THE Wemos ESP32-S2 Mini WITH PLATFORMIO
credit to https://esp32tutorials.com/esp32-wifi-scan-esp-idf/ for the code scaffolding
although looking at the errors and legacy code i'd assume this was ai generated content

found whilst working on another project so there probably wont be any updates 
plus the arduino library has code that does basically the same with a lot less user effort
honestly im just mad at the site for wasting my time

Code function:
  The code uses esp32 wifi to read nearby routers signals and get their ssids along with channel bandwidth and Encryption type
  and outputs via serial (monitor_speed = 115200)
